All larshniks are atheiststo the end...’ And then it was the end, in a coruscating puff of vapour, dead withthose vile words upon his lips, no less than he deserved. ‘Now what?’ Steel asked. ‘This,’ Jax responded, shooting the gun from his hand andimprisoning him instantly with an unbreakable paralysis ray. ‘No moresecond best for me, in the engine room with you on the bridge. This is myball game from here on in.’ ‘Are you mad?’ Steel fluttered through paralysed lips. ‘Sane for the first time in my life. The superlarsh is dead, long live thenew superlarsh. It’s mine, the whole galaxy, mine.’ ‘And what about me?’ ‘I should kill you, but that would be too easy. And you did share yourchocolate bars with me. You will be blamed for this entire debacle, for thedeath of Colonel von Thorax and for the disaster here at larshnik primebase. Every man’s hand will be against you and you will be an outcast andwill flee for your life to the farflung outposts of the galaxy where you will livein terror.’ ‘Remember the chocolate bars!’ ‘I do. All I ever got were the stale ones. Now ... GO!’ * * * * You want to know my name? Old Sarge is good enough. My story? Toomuch for your tender ears, boyo. Just top up the glasses, that’s the way,and join me in a toast. At least that much for a poor old man who has seenmuch in this long lifetime. A toast of bad luck, bad cess I say, may GreatKramddl curse forever the man some know as Gentleman Jax. What,hungry?, not me - no - NO! Not a chocolate bar!!!!!
